## ⚡ What is ASK?

**Agent-Skill-Kit** is a modern, AI-native framework that gives agents (Claude, Copilot, custom bots) **local, keyless superpowers** through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

ASK provides **self-contained skills** that run on your machine using:
- ✅ **Local logic** only (no cloud required)
- ✅ **FREE public APIs** (no auth, no keys)
- ✅ **MCP Integration** (native agent support)
- ✅ **Beautiful Live CLI** (professional TUI)
- ✅ **YAML manifests** (easy skill discovery)
- ✅ **Dynamic skill generation** (The Architect)

Think of it as a "turbo-charged plugin system for AI agents—2026 edition."

---

## ⚡ Quick Start (30 seconds)

```bash
# Install from GitHub
pip install git+https://github.com/HughKnightOCE/Agent-Skill-Kit-ASK-.git

# View available skills  
ask dashboard

# Run a skill
ask run tech-pulse
ask run repo-visualizer
ask run architect "Your idea"
```

**That's it!** No `.env` files. No API key hunting. No OAuth redirects.

---

## 📥 Installation Options

Choose the option that fits your needs:

### **Option 1: pip Package - Recommended (Works everywhere)**
Best for: All users (Windows, Mac, Linux)

```bash
# Install from GitHub
pip install git+https://github.com/HughKnightOCE/Agent-Skill-Kit-ASK-.git

# Or install from wheel file
pip install agent_skill_kit-2.0.0-py3-none-any.whl

# Then use the global command
ask dashboard
ask run tech-pulse
ask run repo-visualizer
```

### **Option 2: Source Installation - Best for Contributors**
Best for: Developers, customization, contributing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HughKnightOCE/Agent-Skill-Kit-ASK-.git
cd Agent-Skill-Kit-ASK-
pip install -e .

# Use the global command
ask dashboard
ask run architect "Convert CSV to JSON"
```

### **Option 3: Desktop GUI - Modern Interface**
Best for: Visual users, no command-line needed

```bash
# Install with GUI support
pip install git+https://github.com/HughKnightOCE/Agent-Skill-Kit-ASK-.git

# Launch the beautiful desktop application
ask-gui
```

This opens a professional PyQt6 desktop application with:
- 🎨 Modern, intuitive interface
- 🔍 Skill browser and search
- 📊 Real-time execution dashboard  
- 📜 Execution history tracking
- ⚡ One-click skill execution with argument forms

[Learn more about the GUI →](gui/README.md)

### **Option 4: Run Source Directly - No Installation**
Best for: Quick testing, trying it out

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HughKnightOCE/Agent-Skill-Kit-ASK-.git
cd Agent-Skill-Kit-ASK-

# Run directly via CLI
ask dashboard
ask run tech-pulse
ask run architect "Your skill description"

# Or launch GUI (requires PyQt6)
pip install PyQt6
ask-gui
```

### **Option 5: Standalone Executable - Zero Dependencies**
Best for: No Python installed, portable use

Download pre-built executables from [Releases](https://github.com/HughKnightOCE/Agent-Skill-Kit-ASK-/releases):

- **Windows**: `ask-gui.exe` - Double-click to run
- **macOS**: `ask-gui` - Run from terminal
- **Linux**: `ask-gui` - Run from terminal

No Python installation required!

### **Windows Command Prompt Troubleshooting**

If `ask` doesn't work in Command Prompt (cmd), use one of these alternatives:

**Option A: Use PowerShell instead** (Recommended)
```powershell
ask dashboard
ask run tech-pulse
ask-gui  # GUI also works great in PowerShell
```

**Option B: Use Python directly** (Works everywhere)
```cmd
python -m core.ask dashboard
python -m core.ask run tech-pulse
```

**Option C: Add Scripts to PATH manually**
```cmd
setx PATH "%PATH%;%APPDATA%\Python\Python314\Scripts"
```
Then restart Command Prompt and try `ask` again.

## 🤝 Contributing: Add Your Own Skill

ASK is designed for **community contributions**. Creating a skill takes **5 minutes**.

### Skill Template

Each skill needs:
1. **`script.py`** - The logic
2. **`manifest.yaml`** - Metadata

### Step 1: Create the Skill Directory

```bash
mkdir -p skills/my-awesome-skill
cd skills/my-awesome-skill
```

### Step 2: Write `script.py`

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""My awesome skill that does X without any API key."""

def main(arg1, arg2=None):
    """Main execution function."""
    print("🎉 My skill output")
    print("✅ Ready for AI agents!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    arg1 = sys.argv[1] if len(sys.argv) > 1 else "default"
    main(arg1)
```

### Step 3: Write `manifest.yaml`

```yaml
name: My Awesome Skill
version: "1.0.0"
description: "Does X without requiring any API keys"

author: "Your Name"
category: "utility"

requirements:
  - name: "python"
    version: ">=3.8"

api_keys_required: false
dependencies: []

usage:
  command: "python script.py"
  args_required:
    - name: "arg1"
      description: "Description of argument"

output_format: "markdown"

tags:
  - "keyless"
  - "local"
```

### Step 4: Test It

```bash
python ../core/ask.py dashboard
python ../core/ask.py run my-awesome-skill
```

### Step 5: Submit a PR

We love contributions! Submit a PR with:
- ✅ Working skill code
- ✅ Proper manifest.yaml
- ✅ Usage example in description
- ✅ No external API keys required

---

## 🎁 Use Cases

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

✅ **All processing is local** - No data leaves your machine (except API calls)  
✅ **No authentication required** - Zero credentials to manage  
✅ **Open source** - Review the code, audit the logic  
✅ **Minimal dependencies** - Less code = less risk
